# Diesease-Prediction-and-Mathematical-Modelling-of-Schizophrenia
Modelling done in python and using Probability and Random Process.

Our basic idea is to quantify Chances of schizophrenia and it's 
chances simple concepts of Probability and Random Process and 
basic mathematical modeling.

For doing so, we've researched and produced results viable to give a 
detailed inference on Schizophrenia using concept of Probability.
